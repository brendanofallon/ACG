ACG is a general-purpose Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tool. It advances the chain by performing Metropolis-Hastings update steps, where each step involves proposing some change to a parameters and calculating likelihoods based on the new state. ACG currently has a lot of functionality built around genetic sequences, so it can estimate likelihood distributions of various population genetic parameters, such as population size. A few nice features are:

* ACG can efficiently compute likelihoods and traverse the space of recombinant genetic sequences. 

  A big focus has been on efficient analysis of recombinant genetic sequences, and ACG can accurately estimate recombination breakpoints from sequences, as well as a host of other features such as time to most recent common ancestor as a function of position along the sequence. ACG is also very modular, and can accomodate plugins as .class or .jar files dropped into a plugins folder. 

ACG is still in the early stages of development. Many of the basic features are implemented, but work is ongoing on the GUI and large refactorings are likely in the near future.
